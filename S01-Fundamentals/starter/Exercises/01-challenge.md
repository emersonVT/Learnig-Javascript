# Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:  
**BMI = mass / (height * height)** (mass in kg and height in meters).

### Task
1.  **Store** Mark's and John's mass and height in variables called `massMark`, `heightMark`, `massJohn` and `heightJohn`.
2.  **Calculate** both their BMIs using the formula, and store the results in two variables called `BMIMark` and `BMIJohn`.
3.  **Log** the value of `BMIMark` and `BMIJohn` to the console.
4.  **BONUS**: Create a boolean variable `markHigherBMI` containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John. Log it to the console too.
