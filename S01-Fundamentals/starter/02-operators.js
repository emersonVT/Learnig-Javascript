Basic JavaScript Operators
========================
Arithmetric Operators
========================
Here we can see arithmetric operators, that we now them from math:
+   addition
-   subtraction
*   multiplication
/   division
%   remainder (modulus)
**  exponent (power)

========================
Assigments operators
========================
We use them to store values in variables
=     assignment
+=    add and assign
-=    subtract and assign
*=    multiply and assign
/=    divide and assign

========================
Logical Operators
========================
We use them with conditions, when we need to make a decision
&&   AND
||   OR
!    NOT

// Basic operators
const year = 2026;
const myAge = 2026 - 2001;
console.log('In the year 2026, I will complete: ' + myAge + ' year olds');
const power = 5 ** 2;
// Means 5 to the powe of 2 = 5 * 5

// Assignments Operators
let x = 5 + 5; // 10
x += 5 // x = x + 5 = 15
x -= 5 // x = x - 5 = 10
x *= 2 // x = 10 * 2 = 20
x++; // x = 20 + 1 = 21
x-- // x = 20 - 1 = 20
